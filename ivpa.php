                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This particular project was a challenge in so many ways, but so satisfying to complete. While the design is not currently in use, designing it and building it in WordPress was quite a delight!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge that I faced when working on this particular design was the subject matter. It is very hard to make school interesting! The vibe I was going for with this design was playful but serious. I tried to stick to the request of the client and used their company colors (Indiana state flag) and kept all of the content they requested. </p>

<p>I did however manage to whittle down a menu system of over 20 items into a smaller more manageable navigation! This was particularly challenging since the client wanted everything everywhere. After doing some analytics research I was able to show the client where their traffic was going and what pages barely got any traction whatsoever. So we moved those down and also did a lot of restructuring of where the content lives to make it make a little bit more sense for someone searching.  </p>

<p>This was one of the projects that I not only got to design from wireframe to mockup, but also had the pleasure of building out into code, and let me tell you, I had no idea how I was going to make the horizontal sections when I was designing it. Luckily that was one of the easiest parts of the whole project once I figured one out, the rest fell into place! I used SCSS and WordPress along with other basic front-end techniques to get this site up and running.</p>
