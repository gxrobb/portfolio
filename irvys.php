                <h2>Project Description</h2>
               <p>This is one of the few projects where I had no direct design involvement. When this project fell into my hands, I was given a very tight deadline and the pressure was on. When I think back at this particular site, I am impressed with how much I was able to do with so little time. </p>

<p>This project was built in WordPress from the ground up. The design was handed to me in Adobe Illustrator and from that, I was able to take what they had created and make it into a living breathing web page.</p>

<p>The website itself is rather heavy when it comes to content and the weight of itâ€™s load time. I advised the client that so much imagery while beautiful, may end up impacting them in the long run when it comes to search engines and user experience. The sliders I also am not in love with, as they tend to hide content instead of accentuate it and also people tend to look past them quickly and disregard them as unimportant or noise.</p>
