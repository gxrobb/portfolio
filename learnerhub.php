                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>Working on Learner Hub was one of my favorite things to do. While I cannot show much of this project, I can certainly go into detail about what the process was like. As you can see above, The basic premise for this application is a Student Management System. I was tasked with creating a new user interface for this particular web app so that the users could do their job better and be more efficient with their time.</p> 

                <p>My involvement with this project started with interviews. I interviewed a few of the users and asked them about their experience with the software and what things were difficult with the interface and what could be improved. </p>

                <p>Aside from the interviews, I also conducted user surveys and got great feedback about the software and where itâ€™s weaknesses were. After I became armed with that information, I began to do very rough wireframes with pen and paper. Getting a general idea of how to lay things out.</p>

                <p>Following that, I began the mockup process and after that, it was a matter of getting approval and start phase 2 of user feedback! </p>
