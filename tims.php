                <h2>Project Description</h2>
               <p>When I was approached with this project, I was asked to help improve the current website design for Timâ€™s Shooting Academy. After a few conversations with the client, we were able to convince them that a redesign was going to be overall better than salvaging an outdated design that was built in tables (I KNOW!!!).</p>

                <p>After some conversation, I was able to determine where their pain points were with the previous website and I got some great feedback on what they wanted to focus on. This was one of my favorite projects because it had an impact on how they run their business.</p>

                <p>I was able to set up for them an entirely new way of accepting signups for their gun safety courses via their website! The users can now sign up for a class right on that very page and receive an email with their ticket. Once at the range, the employee will scan their QR code and check them in for their event! One of the simple ways you can improve an experience not only online, but in person as well. This process improved their way of doing business for the better!</p>
