                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>This project was the third re-design for the Player One Esports website. This particular design was an ambitious undertaking as I needed to account for all facets of the Esports organization and what they wished to accomplish with this website. After a meeting with stakeholders, we came to a combined understanding of what this project would entail.</p>
                <p>The first challenge I faced with this particular project was the scope. At the time of writing this, the development team is still working on adding features that were in the mockup I presented them. Some of those features include an interactive calendar, player and user signups, event tracking and even an online store.</p>


                <p>This was one of the more entertaining projects that I have worked on as it had a lot of unique challenges. For example, there are not a lot of Esports websites out there to take inspiration from, and the ones that exist fall into various bad practice pitfalls such as too much at once and not giving you the information you need readily available.</p>

                <p>Some of the choices I made on this website reflect the requests of the client. For example, the large section in the front (hero) can be swapped out when there is a new event or announcement coming. In addition to that feature, the top also shows a list of upcoming events that if clicked, will take you to a page with more details.</p>

                <p>I created the mockup for this project in Adobe XD and Photoshop. I also spent some time assisting with CSS changes and I had an audit at the end of their sprint to let them know what they missed from the design.</p>
