                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>My name is Robert Kregloh, and I like to consider myself a User Defender! I take everything I learn and apply it to my work in hopes of making a user's experience better. As a Front-End Developer, I take great pride in making sure my designs are 100% responsive and easy to navigate. I love to learn, and I strive to get better every day. </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I've always found myself drawn to building webpages, ever since I was a child. I remember my very first webpage was on angelfire, and it was a Starcraft fan site. Since then I was hooked on creating content and a place for people to build communities and interact on bulletin boards or forums. In college, I explored the world of Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. While it was fun and rewarding, I eventually fell back into web development as it proved to be my true passion.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Growing up with two older brothers in a Nintendo household, gaming was in my viens. Today, while I still enjoy a good video game, my attention has been drawn to the fantastic world of Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy anything tech based: gadgets, Smart Homes, phones, tablets, and servers. You name it, and I probably have tinkered with it!</p>

            <h3>Passions</h3>
            <p>As corny as it may sound, I have a passion for learning. I love experimenting and practicing and getting better. I donâ€™t let failure bring me down. Instead, I let it motivate me to find new ways to succeed.</p>
